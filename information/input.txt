Your shell must implement the following builtins:
◦echo with option -n
◦cd with only a relative or absolute path
◦pwd with no options
◦export with no options
◦unset with no options
◦env with no options or arguments
◦exit with no options
+ all other bash commands


Implement redirections:
◦< should redirect input.
◦> should redirect output.
◦<< should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
◦>> should redirect output in append mode.


Handle:
"
'
|
$variable
$?
ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ 

inside "" handle every unsupported char as literal char
outside "" give back error for unsupported char


Dont handle;
\			read as literal-> e.g. "hello/World" -> "hello/World" not "helloWorld"
\			read as literal-> e.g. "hello;World" -> "hello;World"
;
